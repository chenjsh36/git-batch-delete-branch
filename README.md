## Installation

### Global Installation

```bash
npm install -g git-batch-delete-branch
```

### Local Installation

```bash
npm install git-batch-delete-branch
```

## Usage

### Interactive Mode

Run the tool without any options to enter interactive mode:

```bash
git-batch-delete-branch
```

This will show you all available branches and let you select which ones to delete.

### Keyword Filtering

Delete branches containing a specific keyword:

```bash
# Delete branches containing "feature"
git-batch-delete-branch --filter "feature"

# Delete branches containing "test" (case insensitive)
git-batch-delete-branch -f "test"

# Exclude branches containing "main"
git-batch-delete-branch --filter "main" --exclude
```

### Regex Filtering

Use regular expressions for advanced filtering:

```bash
# Delete branches matching pattern
git-batch-delete-branch --regex "feature/.*"

# Delete branches matching case-sensitive pattern
git-batch-delete-branch -r "RELEASE-.*"

# Exclude branches matching pattern
git-batch-delete-branch --regex "hotfix/.*" --exclude
```

### Preview Mode

Preview what would be deleted without actually deleting:

```bash
git-batch-delete-branch --filter "old" --dry-run
```

### Force Deletion

Skip confirmation prompts:

```bash
git-batch-delete-branch --filter "temp" --force
```

### Include Merged Branches

By default, only unmerged branches are shown. Include merged branches:

```bash
git-batch-delete-branch --include-merged
```

### Verbose Output

Get detailed information about the process:

```bash
git-batch-delete-branch --verbose
```

## Options

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--filter <keyword>` | `-f` | Filter branches by keyword |
| `--regex <pattern>` | `-r` | Filter branches by regex pattern |
| `--dry-run` | | Preview mode (no actual deletion) |
| `--force` | | Force deletion (skip confirmation) |
| `--exclude` | | Exclude matching branches |
| `--include-merged` | | Include merged branches |
| `--verbose` | | Verbose output |
| `--help` | `-h` | Show help information |
| `--version` | `-v` | Show version information |

## Examples

### Delete Feature Branches

```bash
# Delete all feature branches
git-batch-delete-branch --filter "feature"

# Delete only merged feature branches
git-batch-delete-branch --filter "feature" --include-merged
```

### Delete Test Branches

```bash
# Delete branches containing "test"
git-batch-delete-branch --filter "test"

# Preview test branch deletion
git-batch-delete-branch --filter "test" --dry-run
```

### Delete Old Release Branches

```bash
# Delete release branches older than v1.0
git-batch-delete-branch --regex "release-v0\..*"

# Delete all release branches except the latest
git-batch-delete-branch --regex "release-.*" --exclude
```

### Clean Up Temporary Branches

```bash
# Delete temporary branches
git-batch-delete-branch --filter "temp"

# Delete branches with specific naming pattern
git-batch-delete-branch --regex "temp-.*|tmp-.*"
```

## Safety Features

- **Current Branch Protection**: The current branch is automatically excluded from deletion
- **Main Branch Protection**: Main/master branches are protected from deletion
- **Confirmation Prompts**: Users must confirm before deleting branches
- **Preview Mode**: See what would be deleted before executing
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of deletion failures

## Branch Status Indicators

The tool uses visual indicators to show branch status:

- üü¢ `*` - Current branch (protected)
- üîí `üîí` - Main branch (protected)
- ‚úì `‚úì` - Merged branch
- ‚óã `‚óã` - Unmerged branch
- üóëÔ∏è `üóëÔ∏è` - Branch to be deleted

## Output Examples
