## Installation

### Global Installation

```bash
npm install -g @shopee/git-batch-delete-branch
```

### Local Installation

```bash
npm install @shopee/git-batch-delete-branch
```

> **Note**: After installation, you can use `gitt branch` command for interactive branch management.

## Usage

### Interactive Branch Management

Run the main command to enter interactive mode:

```bash
git branch
```

This will show you branch statistics and let you choose between:
- üóëÔ∏è **Delete branches** - Batch delete selected branches
- üîÑ **Switch branch** - Change to a different branch

### Delete Mode

#### Interactive Selection
```bash
gitt branch
# Then select "Delete branches" option
```

#### Keyword Filtering
```bash
# Delete branches containing "feature"
git delete --filter "feature"

# Delete branches containing "test" (case insensitive)
git delete -f "test"

# Exclude branches containing "main"
git delete --filter "main" --exclude
```

### Regex Filtering

Use regular expressions for advanced filtering:

```bash
# Delete branches matching pattern
git delete --regex "feature/.*"

# Delete branches matching case-sensitive pattern
git delete -r "RELEASE-.*"

# Exclude branches matching pattern
git delete --regex "hotfix/.*" --exclude
```

### Preview Mode

Preview what would be deleted without actually deleting:

```bash
git delete --filter "old" --dry-run
```

### Force Deletion

Skip confirmation prompts:

```bash
git delete --filter "temp" --force
```

### Switch Mode

Switch to a different branch:

```bash
gitt branch
# Then select "Switch branch" option
```

This will show you all available branches and let you select which one to switch to.

#### Direct Switch Command

You can also use the dedicated switch command:

```bash
gitt switch
```

This directly opens the branch selection interface for switching.

### Merge Mode

Merge a branch into the current branch:

```bash
gitt merge
```

This will:
1. Show you all available local branches (excluding the current branch)
2. Let you select which branch to merge
3. Perform the merge operation
4. Handle any merge conflicts gracefully

**Note**: Make sure you have committed or stashed any uncommitted changes before merging.

### Include Merged Branches

By default, only unmerged branches are shown. Include merged branches:

```bash
git-batch-delete-branch --include-merged
```

### Verbose Output

Get detailed information about the process:

```bash
git-batch-delete-branch --verbose
```

## Safety Features

- **Current Branch Protection**: The current branch is automatically excluded from deletion
- **Main Branch Protection**: Main/master branches are protected from deletion
- **Confirmation Prompts**: Users must confirm before deleting branches
- **Preview Mode**: See what would be deleted before executing
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of deletion failures
- **Merge Safety**: Checks for uncommitted changes before merging
- **Branch Validation**: Ensures branches exist before operations
- **Conflict Handling**: Graceful handling of merge conflicts

## Branch Status Indicators

The tool uses visual indicators to show branch status:

- üü¢ `*` - Current branch (protected)
- üîí `üîí` - Main branch (protected)
- ‚úì `‚úì` - Merged branch
- ‚óã `‚óã` - Unmerged branch
- üóëÔ∏è `üóëÔ∏è` - Branch to be deleted
- üîÑ `üîÑ` - Branch to be switched to
